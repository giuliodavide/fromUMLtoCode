This script returns an incomplete code of a diagram/object class ".xml" exported with
Visual Paradigm. It has been tested with some working examples available on the
Community Edition of the program itself.
To run the script, open a cmd in the directory of the project and type the following
command:

**python main.py [-c/--class "path/to/class.xml"] [-obj/--object "path/to/object.xml"]**

Path with whitespace will cause problems. We suggest to copy the file in a path without whitespace.
